  <h2> Labs </h2>
    <p> Labs are located in file "labs", my labs are mostly created in VScode using extension Platformio, main code is located in "labx/src/main.cpp" for uploading code to Microcontroler, you can use file "firmware.hex" located in (labx/.pio/build/nanoatmega328/firmware.hex)
  Ex. for lab1: <br>
  <a href="https://github.com/FilipPaul/Digital-Electronics-2/blob/master/labs/lab1/.pio/build/nanoatmega328/firmware.hex">firmware.hex</a> <br>
<a href="https://github.com/FilipPaul/Digital-Electronics-2/blob/master/labs/lab1/src/main.cpp">main.cpp</a>
